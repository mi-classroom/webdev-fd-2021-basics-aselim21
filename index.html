                The challenge is to develop an application that tries to increase the user’s participation in team
                sports
                through
                online
                communities. Several factors play into the success of this concept. It is not possible to achieve this
                goal
                if the
                application is not properly designed. To achieve this, design principles of several disciplines are
                applied
                to
                achieve a
                user-centric solution.

            <h3>User Experience Design</h3>
            <p>
                The term “user experience” was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at
                Apple (NORMAN,
                2013,
                P. XIII F.). User experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its services,
                and its
                products. The focus and most important goal of good user experience is to meet the user’s needs in every
                aspects.
                Close
                cooperation is required between different disciplines, such as engineering, marketing, graphic design,
                industrial
                design, and interface design (NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.).

                <blockquote>
                    » Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit
                    our needs so
                    well
                    that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the
                    other hand, screams
                    out
                    its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable. «

                    User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the
                    visuals, the haptics,
                    and
                    the audio to how the product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary factors:
                    its look, feel,
                    and
                    usability (IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04).

                    Competence is the feeling that one’s actions are perceived as capable and effective instead of
                    thinking that one is
                    incapable and incompetent (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).

                    Relatedness is the feeling of having intimate and personal relationships with the people in the
                    environment, rather than
                    feeling lonely or unnoticed (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).

                    Popularity is the feeling of being respected and influencing others, rather than feeling like a

                Security is the feeling of having stability and control over one’s own life, rather than feeling

                threatened by circumstances one cannot control (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).</dd>

            <p>
                As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in motivating people to
                participate in various
                activities. Thus, it is also an important factor for participation in sports. Since this thesis
                addresses the question
                of how online sports community apps should be designed to increase the user’s participation in team
                sports, the focus
                during the design phase is laid especially on relatedness.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”. In addition to the
                approach of Hassenzahl
                and Diefenbach, other approaches define user needs for good user experience. Design leader Stephen P.
                Anderson, for
                example, developed the “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs” model (→ FIG. 05). Rather than focusing on
                the psychological
                side of the user needs, this model is based on a product’s maturity process. Anderson proposes that
                products proceed
                through six stages of maturity, during which they can grow from a purely functional product, to a
                product that is
                meaningful to the user (ANDERSON, 2011, P. 10F.).

        <h2>Design Methods</h2>
        <p>After discussing the design principles necessary for a good user experience, this section elaborates on specific ways
            to approach the design process.</p>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Community-Centered Design</h2>
        
            <p>It is important to provide members within a community the opportunity to interact with each other (PREECES, 2004,
                P. 3FF). According to Preece, developing online communities is different from designing software as software,
                once shipped, is stable and does not change until the next update while online communities develop and change
                through dynamic interactions. It is first and foremost a social experience that changes according to who is
                participating, the number of people involved, and the type of discussion that takes place (IBID., P.4). For
                example, the dynamics between new and long-established communities differ notably. While the software might not
                change drastically, social interactions will adapt according to the growth of the community. This social
                adaption is called “sociability” (IBID.).</p>
        
            <p> In many online communities, these social changes are at least as influential as software changes. Therefore,
                crucial to not only focus on the usability of the design but also on sociability. Therefore, knowledge from
                different disciplines such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, as well as user-centered design is
                required (IBID.). In participatory community-centered design methodology (→ FIG. 07), members of the community
                are involved in the design process from the beginning. In community-centered design, six phases are each
                followed by an evaluation period and iterations based on the findings.</p>

                <dt>Assess the Needs of the Community</dt>
                <dl>The first step involves understanding the community. This means understanding the community’s needs. It is
                    important to understand who the members of the community are and what the main purpose of the community is.
                    It is about understanding for whom this community exists and what the participants’ habits are (PREECE 2004,
                    P. 4).</dl>
                <dt>Select a Technology Plan for Sociability</dt>
                <dl>After understanding the potential members of the community, it is important to select the technology for
                    communication
                    within the community. Suitable mediums, such as timelines, discussion boards, or chat areas, must be
                    discussed and the
                    software should be tailored to suit the needs of the community (PREECE, 2004, P. 4F.).</dl>
                <dt>Test Prototype</dt>
                <dl>Step three requires testing of the prototype with the potential members of the community. The intended
                    software and
                    sociability structures need to be validated at a basic level. This validation includes the representation of
                    social
                    policies and social interactions. For example, if members must complete a registration policy before joining
                    the
                    community, its comprehensibility must be ensured. In this step, iterative changes are made according to the
                    user
                    feedback (PREECE, 2004, P. 5).</dl>
                <dt>Test Sociability and Usability</dt>
                <dl>Step four extends the testing made in step three and focuses on validating the design choices for good user
                    experience
                    and sociability. The usability, user interface, and the feel of the interaction are tested with the user. At
                    this stage,

                <dl>After establishing the basis for the online community, the final step consists of nurturing the community.
                    It is the
                    most important process as long as the community exists, since nurturing the community allows new members to
                    feel
                    welcomed and supported, thus enabling growth. Furthermore, the community must be well advertised, so that
                    this growth
                    can continue over a long period of time (PREECE, 2004, P. 5F.).</dl>
                <dl>A community-centered design process is crucial to a community’s life cycle, as it ensures that members of
                    respective
                    communities are heard. This assurance allows the design to adapt and change based on their ideas, desires,
                    and needs.
                    Designing for online communities is iterative by nature and should reflect the community’s evolution (IBID.,
                    P. 6).</dl>
