                The challenge is to develop an application that tries to increase the user’s participation in team
                sports
                through
                online
                communities. Several factors play into the success of this concept. It is not possible to achieve this
                goal
                if the
                application is not properly designed. To achieve this, design principles of several disciplines are
                applied
                to
                achieve a
                user-centric solution.

                <p class="marginalia__body"> <strong>Don Norman</strong><br>
                    Director of the Design Lab at the University of California
                    and co-founder of
                    Nielsen Norman

            <p class="marginalia-and-text">
                The term “user experience” was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at
                Apple <em>(NORMAN,
                    2013,
                    P. XIII F.)</em>. User experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its
                services,
                and its
                products. The focus and most important goal of good user experience is to meet the user’s needs in every
                aspects.
                Close
                cooperation is required between different disciplines, such as engineering, marketing, graphic design,
                industrial
                design, and interface design <em>(NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.)</em>.

                    User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the

                    and
                    the audio to how the product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary factors:
                    its look, feel,
                    and

                    Competence is the feeling that one’s actions are perceived as capable and effective instead of
                    thinking that one is
                    incapable and incompetent <em>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</em>.

                    Relatedness is the feeling of having intimate and personal relationships with the people in the
                    environment, rather than
                    feeling lonely or unnoticed <em>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</em>.

                <dd>
                    Popularity is the feeling of being respected and influencing others, rather than feeling like a
                    person whose advice and
                    opinion are ignored <em>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</em>.

            <dd>
                Security is the feeling of having stability and control over one’s own life, rather than feeling
                uncertain and
                threatened by circumstances one cannot control <em>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</em>.</dd>

            <p>
                As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in motivating people to
                participate in various
                activities. Thus, it is also an important factor for participation in sports. Since this thesis
                addresses the question
                of how online sports community apps should be designed to increase the user’s participation in team
                sports, the focus
                during the design phase is laid especially on relatedness.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”. In addition to the
                approach of Hassenzahl
                and Diefenbach, other approaches define user needs for good user experience. Design leader Stephen P.
                Anderson, for
                example, developed the “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs” model (→ FIG. 05). Rather than focusing on
                the psychological
                side of the user needs, this model is based on a product’s maturity process. Anderson proposes that
                products proceed
                through six stages of maturity, during which they can grow from a purely functional product, to a
                product that is
                meaningful to the user <em>(ANDERSON, 2011, P. 10F.)</em>.

            <h2>Design Methods</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>After discussing the design principles necessary for a good user experience, this section elaborates on
                specific ways
                to approach the design process.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Community-Centered Design</h3>

                <p>It is important to provide members within a community the opportunity to interact with each other
                    <em>(PREECES, 2004,
                        P. 3FF)</em>. According to Preece, developing online communities is different from designing
                    software as
                    software,
                    once shipped, is stable and does not change until the next update while online communities develop
                    and change
                    through dynamic interactions. It is first and foremost a social experience that changes according to
                    who is
                    participating, the number of people involved, and the type of discussion that takes place
                    <em>(IBID.,
                        P.4)</em>. For
                    example, the dynamics between new and long-established communities differ notably. While the
                    software might not
                    change drastically, social interactions will adapt according to the growth of the community. This
                    social
                    adaption is called “sociability” <em>(IBID.)</em>.
                </p>

                <p> In many online communities, these social changes are at least as influential as software changes.
                    Therefore,
                    crucial to not only focus on the usability of the design but also on sociability. Therefore,
                    knowledge from
                    different disciplines such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, as well as user-centered
                    design is
                    required (IBID.). In participatory community-centered design methodology (→ FIG. 07), members of the
                    community
                    are involved in the design process from the beginning. In community-centered design, six phases are
                    each
                    followed by an evaluation period and iterations based on the findings.</p>

                    <dt>Assess the Needs of the Community</dt>
                    <dd>The first step involves understanding the community. This means understanding the community’s
                        needs. It is
                        important to understand who the members of the community are and what the main purpose of the
                        community is.
                        It is about understanding for whom this community exists and what the participants’ habits are
                        <em>(PREECE 2004,
                            P. 4)</em>.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Select a Technology Plan for Sociability</dt>
                    <dd>After understanding the potential members of the community, it is important to select the
                        technology for
                        communication
                        within the community. Suitable mediums, such as timelines, discussion boards, or chat areas,
                        must be
                        discussed and the
                        software should be tailored to suit the needs of the community <em>(PREECE, 2004, P. 4F.)</em>.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Test Prototype</dt>
                    <dd>Step three requires testing of the prototype with the potential members of the community. The
                        intended
                        software and
                        sociability structures need to be validated at a basic level. This validation includes the
                        representation of
                        social
                        policies and social interactions. For example, if members must complete a registration policy
                        before joining
                        the
                        community, its comprehensibility must be ensured. In this step, iterative changes are made
                        according to the
                        user
                        feedback <em>(PREECE, 2004, P. 5)</em>.</dd>
                    <dt>Test Sociability and Usability</dt>
                    <dd>Step four extends the testing made in step three and focuses on validating the design choices
                        for good user
                        experience
                        and sociability. The usability, user interface, and the feel of the interaction are tested with
                        the user. At
                        this stage,
                        substantial emphasis is laid on the overall user experience. <em>(PREECE, 2004, P. 5)</em>.</dd>
                    <dt>Nurture the Community</dt>
                    <dd>After establishing the basis for the online community, the final step consists of nurturing the
                        community.
                        It is the
                        most important process as long as the community exists, since nurturing the community allows new
                        members to
                        feel
                        welcomed and supported, thus enabling growth. Furthermore, the community must be well
                        advertised, so that
                        this growth
                        can continue over a long period of time <em>(PREECE, 2004, P. 5F.)</em>.</dd>
                    <dd>A community-centered design process is crucial to a community’s life cycle, as it ensures that
                        members of
                        respective
                        communities are heard. This assurance allows the design to adapt and change based on their
                        ideas, desires,
                        and needs.
                        Designing for online communities is iterative by nature and should reflect the community’s
                        evolution <em>(IBID.,
                            P. 6)</em>.</dd>
