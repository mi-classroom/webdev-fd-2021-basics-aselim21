                The challenge is to develop an application that tries to increase the user’s participation in team
                sports
                through
                online
                communities. Several factors play into the success of this concept. It is not possible to achieve this
                goal
                if the
                application is not properly designed. To achieve this, design principles of several disciplines are
                applied
                to
                achieve a
                user-centric solution.

            <h3>User Experience Design</h3>
            <p>
                The term “user experience” was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at
                Apple (NORMAN,
                2013,
                P. XIII F.). User experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its services,
                and its
                products. The focus and most important goal of good user experience is to meet the user’s needs in every
                aspects.
                Close
                cooperation is required between different disciplines, such as engineering, marketing, graphic design,
                industrial
                design, and interface design (NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.).

                <blockquote>
                    » Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit
                    our needs so
                    well
                    that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the
                    other hand, screams
                    out
                    its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable. «

                    User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the
                    visuals, the haptics,
                    and
                    the audio to how the product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary factors:
                    its look, feel,
                    and
                    usability (IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04).

                    Competence is the feeling that one’s actions are perceived as capable and effective instead of
                    thinking that one is
                    incapable and incompetent (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).

                <dd>
                    Relatedness is the feeling of having intimate and personal relationships with the people in the
                    environment, rather than
                    feeling lonely or unnoticed (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).

                <dd>
                    Popularity is the feeling of being respected and influencing others, rather than feeling like a
                    person whose advice and
                    opinion are ignored (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).

                <dd>
                    Stimulation is the feeling of experiencing much of joy and pleasure instead of feeling bored and
                    understimulated
                    (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).

            <dt>Security</dt>
            <dd>
                Security is the feeling of having stability and control over one’s own life, rather than feeling
                uncertain and
                threatened by circumstances one cannot control (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).</dd>

            <p>
                As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in motivating people to
                participate in various
                activities. Thus, it is also an important factor for participation in sports. Since this thesis
                addresses the question
                of how online sports community apps should be designed to increase the user’s participation in team
                sports, the focus
                during the design phase is laid especially on relatedness.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”. In addition to the
                approach of Hassenzahl
                and Diefenbach, other approaches define user needs for good user experience. Design leader Stephen P.
                Anderson, for
                example, developed the “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs” model (→ FIG. 05). Rather than focusing on
                the psychological
                side of the user needs, this model is based on a product’s maturity process. Anderson proposes that
                products proceed
                through six stages of maturity, during which they can grow from a purely functional product, to a
                product that is
                meaningful to the user (ANDERSON, 2011, P. 10F.).
