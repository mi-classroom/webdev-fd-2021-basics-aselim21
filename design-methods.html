<h1>Design Methods</h1>

<p>After discussing the design principles necessary for a good user experience, this section elaborates on specific ways
    to approach the design process.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Community-Centered Design</h2>

    <p>It is important to provide members within a community the opportunity to interact with each other (PREECES, 2004,
        P. 3FF). According to Preece, developing online communities is different from designing software as software,
        once shipped, is stable and does not change until the next update while online communities develop and change
        through dynamic interactions. It is first and foremost a social experience that changes according to who is
        participating, the number of people involved, and the type of discussion that takes place (IBID., P.4). For
        example, the dynamics between new and long-established communities differ notably. While the software might not
        change drastically, social interactions will adapt according to the growth of the community. This social
        adaption is called “sociability” (IBID.).</p>

    <p> In many online communities, these social changes are at least as influential as software changes. Therefore,
        crucial to not only focus on the usability of the design but also on sociability. Therefore, knowledge from
        different disciplines such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, as well as user-centered design is
        required (IBID.). In participatory community-centered design methodology (→ FIG. 07), members of the community
        are involved in the design process from the beginning. In community-centered design, six phases are each
        followed by an evaluation period and iterations based on the findings.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Assess the Needs of the Community</dt>
        <dl>The first step involves understanding the community. This means understanding the community’s needs. It is
            important to understand who the members of the community are and what the main purpose of the community is.
            It is about understanding for whom this community exists and what the participants’ habits are (PREECE 2004,
            P. 4).</dl>
        <dt>Select a Technology Plan for Sociability</dt>
        <dl>After understanding the potential members of the community, it is important to select the technology for
            communication
            within the community. Suitable mediums, such as timelines, discussion boards, or chat areas, must be
            discussed and the
            software should be tailored to suit the needs of the community (PREECE, 2004, P. 4F.).</dl>
        <dt>Test Prototype</dt>
        <dl>Step three requires testing of the prototype with the potential members of the community. The intended
            software and
            sociability structures need to be validated at a basic level. This validation includes the representation of
            social
            policies and social interactions. For example, if members must complete a registration policy before joining
            the
            community, its comprehensibility must be ensured. In this step, iterative changes are made according to the
            user
            feedback (PREECE, 2004, P. 5).</dl>
        <dt>Test Sociability and Usability</dt>
        <dl>Step four extends the testing made in step three and focuses on validating the design choices for good user
            experience
            and sociability. The usability, user interface, and the feel of the interaction are tested with the user. At
            this stage,
            substantial emphasis is laid on the overall user experience. (PREECE, 2004, P. 5).</dl>
        <dt>Nurture the Community</dt>
        <dl>After establishing the basis for the online community, the final step consists of nurturing the community.
            It is the
            most important process as long as the community exists, since nurturing the community allows new members to
            feel
            welcomed and supported, thus enabling growth. Furthermore, the community must be well advertised, so that
            this growth
            can continue over a long period of time (PREECE, 2004, P. 5F.).</dl>
        <dl>A community-centered design process is crucial to a community’s life cycle, as it ensures that members of
            respective
            communities are heard. This assurance allows the design to adapt and change based on their ideas, desires,
            and needs.
            Designing for online communities is iterative by nature and should reflect the community’s evolution (IBID.,
            P. 6).</dl>
